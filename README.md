# AVWriterExample
This project was created to help developers who are interested in experimenting with the Vision framework and other frameworks which are dependent on the use of the AVCaptureVideoDataOutputSampleBufferDelegate and AVCaptureAudioDataOutputSampleBufferDelegate protocols. 

I plan to add a bit of a tutorial to this Readme in the future.

Please note: This is NOT a production ready example! If you would like to help move it in that direction please feel free to issue "Pull requests".
